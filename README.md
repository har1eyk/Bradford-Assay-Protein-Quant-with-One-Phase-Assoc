# Bradford-Assay-Protein-Quant-with-One-Phase-Assoc
The Bradford method is a popular biochemical technique for determining the concentration of protein. 

A common kit like the Thermo Fisher Scientific (cat. no. 23236, http://bit.ly/2DaYy7C) uses the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye molecule. In the presence the protein, a conformational state in the dye is stabilized resulting in a color change. The color change is proportional to the amount of protein and can be detected by a spectrophotometer reading absorbance at 595 nm.

Precise protein concentration is an important characteristic for downstream experiments like ELISAs, protein-protein interactions and isothermal titration calorimetry.

Although the dye and protein react in a proportional manner and can be characterized with a linear model, high concentrations of protein will stabilize most dye molecules causing saturation. This is true of BSA standards diluting to 2000ug/ml as the protocol recommends. The curve is better approximated by a non-linear regression method.

# Non-linear Regression One Phase Association


Protein concentration is an important characteristic for downstream experiments like ELISAs, protein-protein interactions and isothermal titration calorimetry. 

The one phase association non-linear regression model best describes protein standards assayed via the Bradford technique. Unknown protein samples can be interpolated.
